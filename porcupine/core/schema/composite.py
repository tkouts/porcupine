    Objects within Objects...

    Think of this as an embedded item. This class is useful
    for implementing compositions. Instances of this class
    are embedded into other items.
    Note that instances of this class have no
    security descriptor since they are embedded into other items.
    The L{security} property of such instances is actually a proxy to
    the security attribute of the object that embeds this object.
    Moreover, they do not have parent containers the way
    instances of L{GenericItem} have.
